                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>When a ship is caught up in a storm, it's captain finds the most unlikely of saviours - but nobody
                    back in the town of
                    "Rockwell" believes him! Hardly surprising as he claimed to have been rescued by an hundred foot
                    robot with bright
                    yellow eyes. "Hogarth" is an enthusiastic young lad who wants to keep a pet. His mother ("Annie") is
                    having nothing to
                    do with this, especially after one of his candidates manages to just about wreck the diner where she
                    works and turn
                    scrap man "Dean" into "Deana" in the process. Dejected at home alone, he hears some strange noises
                    and armed with his
                    pop gun and a torch, sets off into the forest to find the source. When he discovers that the
                    fisherman's tale wasn't so
                    long after all, the pair begin to bond and the story takes on a familiar look. It does have shades
                    of "The Day The Earth
                    Stood Still" as it shows clearly the typical reaction to something strange, new and big - the
                    government and the army
                    are soon in hot pursuit with little intent on diplomacy but with plenty of tanks, missiles and
                    ultimately the "bomb" -
                    just as destructive to them as to the "monster". It's really the characterisations that help this
                    stand out. The style
                    of animation is simple yet potent, the creature positively emanates a degree of decency and charisma
                    and the
                    relationship with the young boy that manifests itself to us is one that amiably resonates whether
                    that be with a real
                    friend, an imaginary one - or one from outer space who doesn't much like guns and has an almost
                    infantile approach to
                    life. Proof that when you have a solid story and tell it well, the gadgets, gismos (and there are a
                    few, here) and
                    visual effects don't matter so much as the soul of the thing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Imagine you confront your enemy--a giant, scary robot from outer space--and he becomes your best pal.
                    A young boy
                    befriends a monster in the heartwarming animated feature The Iron Giant.October, 1957. Nine-year-old
                    Hogarth Hughes (Eli
                    Marienthal) lives in Rockwell, Maine, a seemingly idyllic town. Hearing stories of a UFO that
                    crashed into the sea,
                    Hogarth, always on the lookout for mutant aliens, finds a huge, metal-eating robot (Vin Diesel) with
                    an insatiable
                    curiosity and equally insatiable appetite. But the extraterrestrial's presence unleashes a wave of
                    Cold War paranoia
                    that threatens to engulf Rockwell unless Hogarth and his 50-foot friend can stop it.Acclaimed
                    animation director and
                    writer Brad Bird brings his creative talents to the big screen in this unique tale of two heroes. In
                    times like these,
                    you really find out what your friends are made of ... sometimes it's metal, if your best buddy's The
                    Iron Giant.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The film's development phase began around 1994, though the project finally started taking root once
                    Bird signed on as
                    director, and his hiring of Tim McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The script was given
                    approval by Ted Hughes,
                    author of the original novel, and production struggled through difficulties (Bird even enlisted the
                    aid of a group of
                    students from CalArts).

                    Upon its release, the film saw wide critical acclaim from critics and audiences. It was nominated
                    for several awards,
                    winning nine Annie Awards. Due to an unusually poor marketing campaign, the film significantly
                    under-performed at the
                    box office, making $31.3 million worldwide against a budget of $70â€“80 million. Through home video
                    releases and
                    television syndication, the film gathered a cult following and is now widely regarded as a modern
                    animated classic. An
                    extended, remastered version of the film was screened theatrically in 2015, preceding a release on
                    Blu-ray Disc.</p>
                <p>In October 1957, shortly after the Russian satellite Sputnik is put into orbit, an enormous robot
                    from outer space
                    crashes into the ocean near Rockwell, Maine. The robot makes its way inland and wanders into the
                    forest.

                    Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes discovers the robot one night as it begins eating the powerlines of an
                    electrical
                    substation and electrocutes itself. Hogarth shuts down the power, saving the robot, and returns
                    home. Several days
                    later, Hogarth makes it his mission to find the robot and take a picture. After hours of waiting,
                    the robot surprises
                    Hogarth, who soon befriends him. Suffering amnesia, the Iron Giant accompanies Hogarth wherever he
                    goes. When they come
                    across a railroad, the Giant starts eating the rails. Hearing an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the
                    Giant to repair the
                    tracks. As he does, the train collides, breaking him into pieces. The Giant's parts start to
                    reassemble, and Hogarth
                    hides the damaged robot in his house's barn, where the parts can repair themselves.

                    Later, after dinner with his widowed mother Annie, Hogarth reads comic books to the Giant. The Giant
                    is impressed with
                    Superman, but discovers the comic 'Atomo the Metal Menace.' Hogarth reassures the Giant that he is
                    more like Superman
                    than Atomo. In the meantime, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley arrives, discovering possible
                    evidence of the Giant.
                    Finding Hogarth's BB gun near the substation, Mansley takes a room for rent at Hogarth's home and
                    follows the boy
                    around, hoping to learn more. Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to the junkyard for Dean
                    McCoppin, a beatnik
                    who had earlier befriended Hogarth, for shelter. Hogarth soon has to discuss "death" with the Giant
                    after they witness
                    hunters shoot a stag in the forest. Paranoid about the alien invasion, Mansley alerts the U.S. Army
                    to the presence of
                    the Giant. When he and General Kenneth Rogard, backed by Army troops, force the investigation, Dean
                    reveals the robot
                    disguised as a scrap-metal artwork. Rogard admonishes Mansley and leaves. Later, Hogarth plays with
                    the Giant using a
                    toy gun, which automatically activates the Giant's weaponry. Dean saves Hogarth and demands the
                    Giant to leave. Thinking
                    the giant never meant any harm, Hogarth runs after him. Dean finds the toy gun and realizes the
                    Giant was only reacting
                    defensively. He catches Hogarth with his motorbike as the Giant reaches town.

                    In Rockwell, the Giant saves two boys falling from a roof to the amazement of witnesses. The Army
                    troops see the Giant,
                    return, and attack while requesting Navy and Air Force support. The Giant flies away with Hogarth
                    and even though being
                    attacked by a USAF F-86 Sabre, the Giant kept his original programming from taking over and fighting
                    back, however,
                    after he was shot down, the Giant mistakenly believes the unconscious Hogarth has been killed. The
                    Giant becomes both
                    saddened and enraged at Hogarth's death. He allows his defensive programming to take over and
                    activates his energy
                    weapons and battles the completely outmatched Army. Mansley lies to Rogard that the robot killed
                    Hogarth and suggests he
                    can be destroyed at sea with a Polaris nuclear missile from the USS Nautilus.

                    Hogarth wakes up and calms the Giant, causing him to deactivate his weapons. As Mansley keeps
                    telling Rogard to attack,
                    Dean says the Giant never harmed anyone and that any attack on the Giant is triggering a defense
                    mechanism. Seeing
                    Hogarth alive, Rogard has the Army stand down, but before he can tell the Nautilus the same thing, a
                    panicked Mansley
                    grabs the walkie talkie and orders the missile launch anyway without thinking. Furious, Rogard
                    reminds Mansley that the
                    missile, currently targeted on the Giant, will also kill everyone in Rockwell including himself.
                    When Mansley cowardly
                    attempts to flee, the Giant stops him and the Army forces Mansley to stay and die with them. Hogarth
                    tells the Giant of
                    Rockwell's impending fate and the Giant makes the decision to fly off, smiling to himself that he
                    chooses to be
                    Superman, and not a weapon. The Giant uses his body to intercept the missile before it reaches
                    Rockwell, causing a
                    massive explosion high in the atmosphere. The townspeople and soldiers are all very relieved to have
                    survived, but are
                    saddened by the Giant's apparent sacrifice.

                    Sometime later, Annie and Dean are dating and Dean has built a statue in the park to honor the Giant
                    from the grateful
                    citizens of Rockwell. Hogarth receives a package from General Rogard, a small bolt, the only piece
                    of the Giant that was
                    ever found. That night, Hogarth hears a familiar beeping coming from the bolt, which is trying to
                    get out of the window.
                    Hogarth opens the window to let the bolt out, happy once again.

                    Somewhere on the LangjÃ¶kull Glacier in Iceland, the Giant is somehow still functional and begins to
                    repair and rebuild
                    himself. Parts of the Giant approach where his head rests. The Giant wakes up and smiles.</p>
