        <p>When a ship is caught up in a storm, it's captain finds the most unlikely of saviours - but nobody back in
            the town of
            "Rockwell" believes him! Hardly surprising as he claimed to have been rescued by an hundred foot robot with
            bright
            yellow eyes. "Hogarth" is an enthusiastic young lad who wants to keep a pet. His mother ("Annie") is having
            nothing to
            do with this, especially after one of his candidates manages to just about wreck the diner where she works
            and turn
            scrap man "Dean" into "Deana" in the process. Dejected at home alone, he hears some strange noises and armed
            with his
            pop gun and a torch, sets off into the forest to find the source. When he discovers that the fisherman's
            tale wasn't so
            long after all, the pair begin to bond and the story takes on a familiar look. It does have shades of "The
            Day The Earth
            Stood Still" as it shows clearly the typical reaction to something strange, new and big - the government and
            the army
            are soon in hot pursuit with little intent on diplomacy but with plenty of tanks, missiles and ultimately
            the "bomb" -
            just as destructive to them as to the "monster". It's really the characterisations that help this stand out.
            The style
            of animation is simple yet potent, the creature positively emanates a degree of decency and charisma and the
            relationship with the young boy that manifests itself to us is one that amiably resonates whether that be
            with a real
            friend, an imaginary one - or one from outer space who doesn't much like guns and has an almost infantile
            approach to
            life. Proof that when you have a solid story and tell it well, the gadgets, gismos (and there are a few,
            here) and
            visual effects don't matter so much as the soul of the thing.</p>
